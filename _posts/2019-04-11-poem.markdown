*i*

Half past three  
and we still haven't forced a corner\.  
The dripping Bovril our only drink,  
The bloody hotdog our only food.

Do I dare  
make my way up to the conveniences  
at the top of the Holmesdale?

Midwinter is its own season,  
end-to-end stuff yet goalless at half-time\. .    
I sometimes wonder if that is what Big Mal meant -  
among other things - when he said that football  
was a game of four halves.

*la la la*

&nbsp;

*ii*

Oh Lord,

there is no end of it, the clueless wailing  
of *Eagles, Eagles, Eagles*  
(to the tune of Amazing Grace),  
voices singing out of empty beer cans\.  
I do not think they will sing to me.

And then the raising of the scarves.

The football does not matter\.  
There is only the fight to recover  
what has been lost  
and found and lost again and again:  
and now without a midfield general  
like Kember to win the ball.

Twit twit twit

&nbsp;

*iii*

Twenty odd years largely wasted, time before  
and time after, always returning  
to eighteenth position in Division Two. La la la.

April is the cruellest month, making  
relegation a mathematical probability  
in the last game at Highbury.

No! I'm not Kenny Samson, nor was meant to be\.  
Here I am, an old misery with a dry mouth,  
being started at by away fans, waiting for a goal\.  
I was neither at the Spurs game,  
nor half pissed on the special from Stoke, heaving  
out of the window, surprised by Leeds fans,  
fought. O O O O this South East Twenty Five drag -  
It's so inelegant  
so unintelligent.

*Saaaf luuunduuun la la la  
saaaf luuunduuun lalala*

God, it drives me mad.

&nbsp;

*iv*

The scoreboard read  
'Four o'clock'  
(and flashed the attendance underneath)\.  
In the waning dusk past half-cut features I cried  
'What! are you here? Proctor, you old bugger.'  
And he: 'Last Season's team was relegated,  
just face up to it, Pete. And when will Salako  
kick a ball again?' Alas\.  
He left me with a wave and a 'Cheerio'  
and faded on the full-time whistle\.  
This is the way the game ends\.  
Not with a goal but with a throw in.

'Five o'clock'.

I stopped off at The Cherry Tree  
for a quick pint  
(jug jug) and reflected:  
'Well now that's done: and I'm glad it's over,  
Glad all over, yes, yes,  
I'm feeling glad all over.'

*Ooo aah ooo aah ooo aah George Ndah  
Ta ta goonight goonight ta ta  
la la la*

Notes on '*Pinkey and other Observations*'

Not only the title, but the plan and a good deal of the incidental symbolism of the poem were suggested by Malcolm Allison's autobiography Colours of My Life (Everest 1975).

I.2 A phenomenon which I have often observed.

I.26 Stephen David Kember was born in Croydon on 8 December, 1948 during a period of severe post-war rationing. He ended his playing career with Vancouver Whitecaps.

I.34 Kenneth Graham Samson was born in 1958; his transfer to Arsenal on 14 August, 1980 precipitated what came to be known as the 'left-back' syndrome at Selhurst and a swift decline in the club's fortunes.

II.38-40 cf, Preposterous Tales (I, Ludicrous) ("I once saw the Palace score four goals/away from home")

I.60 The Cherry Tree still sits conveniently near to Norwood Junction; it has, to my mind, one of the finest interiors of the area's many post-match watering holes. There are, to the best of my knowledge, no actual cherry trees on the premises.

John Stanley Proctor, although a mere spectator and not indeed a "character", is yet the most important personage in the poem, uniting all the rest. He stands for all those thousands, so many, who came along to watch a game of football and found something else there instead.
